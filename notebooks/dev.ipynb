Faction keywords can be used to help you decide which models to include in your army, but otherwise both sets of keywords are functionally the same. In either case, keywords appear in Keyword Bold. Keywords are sometimes linked to (or ‘tagged’ by) a rule. For example, a rule might say that it applies to Infantry units.

      "BATTLEFIELD\n",
      "Battles of Warhammer 40,000 are fought on rectangular battlefields. This can be any surface upon which the models can stand – a dining table, for example, or the floor. Y our mission will guide you as to the size of battlefield required.\n",
      "TERRAIN FEATURES\n",
      "The scenery on a battlefield can be represented by models from the Warhammer 40,000 range. These models are called terrain features to differentiate them from the models that make up an army. Terrain features are set up on the battlefield before the battle begins. Y ou can find out more about terrain features on pages 44-48.\n",
      "Unless the mission you are playing instructs you otherwise, you \n",

      "MEASURING DISTANCES\n",
      "Distances in Warhammer 40,000 are measured in inches (\"). Y ou can measure distances whenever you wish.\n",
      "When measuring the distance between models, measure \n",
      "between the closest points of the bases of the models you’re measuring to and from. If a model does not have a base, measure to the closest point of any part of that model instead. \n",
      "If a rule says it applies ‘within’ a certain distance, it applies at \n",
      "any distance that is not more than the specified distance. For example, within 1\" means any distance that is not more than 1\" away.Hints and Tips\n",
      "WOBBLY MODELS\n",
      "Sometimes you may find that a \n",
      "particular terrain feature makes it hard for you to place a model exactly where you want to. If you delicately balance a model in place, it is very likely to fall as soon as someone nudges the table, leaving your painted model damaged or even broken. \n",
      "In cases like this, provided it is still physically possible to place the model in the desired location, you may find it helps to leave a model in a safer position, provided both players agree and know its ‘actual’ location.

      " Unit Coherency is a rule in Warhammer 40,000 that states that a unit with more than one model must be set up and end any kind of move within a certain distance of at least one other model from that unit. This distance is 2\" horizontally and 5\" vertically for units with 2-6 models, and 2\" horizontally and 5\" vertically for units with 7 or more models. If a model cannot be set up or end a move within this distance, it is destroyed. Additionally, at the end of each turn, players must remove models from any units that are no longer in unit coherency until only a single group of models remains in play.\n"
